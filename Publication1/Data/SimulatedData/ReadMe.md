# Simulated Communities

## Files
- SpeciesPool.zip: simulated regional species pool, including tree, phylogenetic distance matrix, trait values, and metacommunity abundance profile under different scenarios of phylogenetic signal. 
- NoComp1.zip, NoComp2.zip, NoComp3.zip: simulated local communities without competition.
- FiltComp: simulated local communities with different intensities of competition.
- expect.process.csv: expected relative importance of different assembly processes and stochasticity for each group of comparions within or between plots.
- treatment.csv: plot ID of each simulated sample (local community).
